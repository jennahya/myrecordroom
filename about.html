            <p>
              It's no secret that I love music, and I love collecting records. There’s something
              grounding about holding an album in my hands — the artwork, the liner notes, the
              sense of a whole world the artist built.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              This site is my personal archive. It helps me keep track of the records I own, some
              of the ones I’m searching for, and the little stories that made each album matter.
              It isn’t complete or perfect, but it captures most of my collection.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Feel free to explore, wander through the shelves, and read the notes I’ve left
              behind each record. This space is meant to be a quiet room to sit with music.
            </p>
